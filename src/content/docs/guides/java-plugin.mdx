This guide walks you through creating a minimal Java plugin for Hytale using Gradle. By the end you will have a plugin that loads on the server and logs a message on startup.

## Requirements

1. **Java 25 JDK** installed. The game is built on Java 21 but runs on Java 25.
2. A **code editor** of your choice.
3. If your IDE doesnt include gradle project generation, install the **Gradle** CLI tool to create a gradle wrapper.
4. **Hytale** installed via the official launcher (only needed to run a local dev server, not to build).

## Project Structure

A Hytale plugin follows standard Gradle/Java conventions. The only addition is a `manifest.json` that describes your plugin to the game.

<FileTree>
- build.gradle
- settings.gradle
- gradle.properties
- gradlew / gradlew.bat
- .gitignore
- gradle/
  - wrapper/
    - gradle-wrapper.jar
    - gradle-wrapper.properties
- src/
  - main/
    - java/
      - com/example/myplugin/
        - **MyPlugin.java** plugin entry point
    - resources/
      - **manifest.json** plugin metadata
- run/ server working directory (gitignored)
</FileTree>

## Setting Up the Project

<Steps>

1. **Create a new Gradle project** or clone an existing template. The Gradle wrapper is included so you don't need Gradle installed globally — just run `./gradlew` from the project root.

2. **Configure `settings.gradle`** — set your project name. This becomes the base name for JAR files produced by Gradle.

   <Code code={settingsGradle} lang="groovy" title="settings.gradle" />

3. **Configure `gradle.properties`** — define your version, Maven group, Java version, and build flags. Every property here is referenced by `build.gradle`.

   <Code code={gradleProperties} lang="properties" title="gradle.properties" />

   <Aside>
   The `maven_group` property is a namespace identifier used for Maven publishing and should be unique to your organization. If you own a domain (e.g., `example.com`), use the reverse domain as your group (e.g., `com.example`). If you don't have a domain, use a unique identifier like your GitHub username or organization name (e.g., `io.github.yourusername` or `com.yourname`). This is **not** the same as the `Group` field in `manifest.json`.
   </Aside>

4. **Set up `build.gradle`** — this is the core of the build system. It adds the Hytale server JAR to your classpath, auto-updates your manifest, and provides a `runServer` task for local development.

   <Code code={buildGradle} lang="groovy" title="build.gradle" />

   Key things this does:
   - Pulls the Hytale server JAR from the [official Maven repository](https://maven.hytale.com) as a compile dependency.
   - Defines an `updatePluginManifest` task that syncs `Version` and `IncludesAssetPack` from your Gradle properties into `manifest.json` every build.
   - Defines a `runServer` task that launches a local Hytale server with your plugin loaded.

5. **Create `manifest.json`** — this tells Hytale about your plugin. The `Main` field must point to your plugin's entry class.

   <Code code={manifestJson} lang="json" title="src/main/resources/manifest.json" />

   | Field | Description |
   |---|---|
   | `Group` | Your organization or team name — displayed to players as the plugin's author group |
   | `Name` | Plugin display name |
   | `Version` | Semantic version (auto-updated by Gradle) |
   | `Main` | Fully qualified class name of your [`JavaPlugin`](https://hysrc.ginco.gg/#1/local/com/hypixel/hytale/server/core/plugin/JavaPlugin) subclass |
   | `IncludesAssetPack` | Set `true` if your plugin bundles game assets |
   | `ServerVersion` | Server version constraint (`*` for any) |

6. **Add a `.gitignore`** to exclude build artifacts and the server runtime directory.

   <Code code={gitignore} lang="sh" title=".gitignore" />

</Steps>

## Writing the Plugin

Every plugin needs a main class that extends [`JavaPlugin`](https://hysrc.ginco.gg/#1/local/com/hypixel/hytale/server/core/plugin/JavaPlugin). This is the class referenced by `Main` in your manifest. The constructor runs when the plugin is loaded, and `setup()` is called when the server is ready for you to register functionality like commands and event listeners.

<Code code={MyPlugin} lang="java" title="src/main/java/com/example/myplugin/MyPlugin.java" />

That's it — this plugin will log two messages to the server console when it loads.

## Running the Server

<Steps>

1. **Start the server** using the `runServer` Gradle task:

   ```sh
   ./gradlew runServer
   ```

2. **Authenticate the server.** You must do this before any client can connect. In the server terminal, run:

   ```
   auth login device
   ```

   This prints a URL — open it in your browser and sign in with your Hytale account. Then persist the session so you don't have to re-authenticate every time:

   ```
   auth persistence Encrypted
   ```

   <Aside type="danger">
   Never share your encrypted auth file with anyone.
   </Aside>

   If you cannot type into the server terminal, you can trigger authentication from code temporarily:

   ```java
   @Override
   protected void start() {
       CommandManager.get().handleCommand(ConsoleSender.INSTANCE, "auth login device");
   }
   ```

   Remove this code after your server is authenticated.

3. **Connect from the Hytale client.** Open the game and connect to `Local Server`. If it doesn't appear automatically, add `127.0.0.1` manually.

4. **Verify the plugin.** Check the server console for your plugin's log messages.

</Steps>

## Building for Distribution

To build a shareable JAR file, run:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

The output JAR is written to `build/libs/`. Players can install your plugin by placing the JAR in their `%APPDATA%/Hytale/UserData/Mods` folder.
