import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

## Example FileTree

<FileTree>
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
- src
  - components
    - Header.astro
    - Title.astro
  - pages/
</FileTree>
